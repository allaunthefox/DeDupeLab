GDrive Migration Log
Generated by: assistant
Date: 2025-11-16 16:58:00 (UTC)

Overview
- Purpose: Clean-slate migration and removal of temporary FLAC folders.
- Remote: `Gdrive:` (configured rclone remote)
- Key saved artifacts created during session:
  - `/home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt` (initial full tree listing)
  - `/home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt` (preview of new `Active/` tree)

Actions performed (commands executed and brief results)
1) Inspected rclone remotes and version
  - Command: `rclone listremotes && rclone version`
  - Result: Remote `Gdrive:` present; rclone v1.71.0

2) Created initial tree listing of remote
  - Command: `rclone tree Gdrive: > /home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt`
  - Result: Saved initial tree (≈3.0 MB, ~46k lines) at `/home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt`

3) Determined that local `/home/allaun/Gdrive/TempFlac` existed, but remote path was different
  - Local `du`/`find` run showed ~159G and ~5591 files under the local mount.

4) Purged temporary FLAC folders (per user explicit confirmation)
  - Commands executed:
    - `rclone purge Gdrive:Music-backup`
    - `rclone purge Gdrive:Entertainment`
  - Result: Both remote folders were purged successfully. These deletions are irreversible.
  - Verification: `rclone lsd Gdrive:` afterwards showed no `Music-backup` or `Entertainment` at root.

5) Created new target structure on remote
  - Command: a series of `rclone mkdir` calls to create:
    - `Gdrive:Active/{Documents,Personal,Music,Entertainment}`
    - `Gdrive:Archives/{Documents,Personal,Backups}`
    - `Gdrive:Inbox`, `Gdrive:System`
  - Result: directories created on `Gdrive:` (server-side directories created).

6) Performed migration moves into the new structure
  - Commands (executed with `rclone move`):
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Documents Gdrive:Active/Documents`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Documents／General／" Gdrive:Active/Documents`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Personal Gdrive:Active/Personal`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Backups Gdrive:Archives/Backups`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Archives／Backups／" Gdrive:Archives/Backups`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:HelloFax Gdrive:Inbox`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Uncategorized／" Gdrive:Inbox/Uncategorized-ToSort`
  - Result: Server-side moves used where possible; large content (document/ebooks/comics/audiobooks) moved into `Gdrive:Active` and `Gdrive:Archives`. Transfer summary from rclone:
    - Transferred/Server side moves: ~12.786 GiB moved (422 items transferred / renamed; server-side moves used where available)
    - Many moves completed successfully; remaining moved items handled by rclone via file moves when server-side directory move wasn't possible.
  - Note: `Gdrive:Music-backup` and `Gdrive:Entertainment` had already been purged earlier, so there was nothing to move into `Active/Music` or `Active/Entertainment`.

7) Verification and previews
  - Command: `rclone lsd Gdrive:` and `rclone tree Gdrive:Active | head -n 200 > /home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt`
  - Result: Preview saved at `/home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt` and root shows new `Active/` and `Archives/` folders.

Files created during the session
- `/home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt` (initial remote tree before purge)
- `/home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt` (preview of new Active tree)
- `/home/allaun/gdrive_migration_log.txt` (this log)

Notes, risks & recovery
- The two folders `Gdrive:Music-backup` and `Gdrive:Entertainment` were permanently purged by explicit user instruction and cannot be recovered from the remote.
- For any further deletions, I recommend creating a dated archive folder as an intermediate step, or running `--dry-run` before `rclone move`/`purge`.
- If you want a complete rclone operation log with full rclone debug output for auditing, we can re-run relevant `rclone` commands with `--log-file /path/to/log --log-level DEBUG` (non-destructive dry-run preferred).

Suggested next steps
- If you want a complete final snapshot, I can run:
  - `rclone tree Gdrive: > /home/allaun/gdrive_tree_after_migration.txt` (full updated tree)
  - `rclone size Gdrive:Active Gdrive:Archives` to verify remote sizes
  - `rclone rmdirs Gdrive:` to remove any empty legacy directories
- Optionally, run duplicate detection on remaining remote content (requires fetching checksums or download for hashing) or use `rclone crypt`/`rclone dedupe` helpers if applicable.

Appendix: Terminal session details (exact commands run and notable outputs)

A) rclone remote and version
  - Command: `rclone listremotes && rclone version`
  - Output summary: remote `Gdrive:` present; `rclone v1.71.0`

B) Initial remote top-level (BEFORE cleanup)
  - Command run earlier: `rclone lsd Gdrive:` (initial)
  - Notable top-level entries observed before deletion/migration:
    - `Music-backup`
    - `Entertainment`
    - `Documents`
    - `Backups`
    - `HelloFax`
    - `Personal`
    - other folders (existing prior to migration)

C) Saved initial full tree
  - Command: `rclone tree Gdrive: > /home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt`
  - File: `/home/allaun/gdrive_tree.txt` (initial snapshot; ~3.0 MB, ~46k lines)

D) Attempts to purge `TempFlac`
  - Command: `rclone purge Gdrive:TempFlac`
  - Result: failed with `directory not found` (the mounted local path did not correspond to that exact remote path)

E) Purges performed (user confirmed deletion phrases)
  - Commands executed:
    - `rclone purge Gdrive:Music-backup`
    - `rclone purge Gdrive:Entertainment`
  - Result: both purges completed (remote folders removed). This is irreversible.

F) Created new structure on remote (commands used)
  - Commands (executed as a single block):
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Active`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Active/Documents`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Active/Personal`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Active/Music`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Active/Entertainment`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Archives`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Archives/Documents`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Archives/Personal`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Archives/Backups`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:Inbox`
    - `rclone mkdir Gdrive:System`

G) Migration moves (exact commands executed)
  - Primary move commands (rclone move):
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Documents Gdrive:Active/Documents`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Documents／General／" Gdrive:Active/Documents`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Personal Gdrive:Active/Personal`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:Backups Gdrive:Archives/Backups`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Archives／Backups／" Gdrive:Archives/Backups`
    - `rclone move Gdrive:HelloFax Gdrive:Inbox`
    - `rclone move "Gdrive:Uncategorized／" Gdrive:Inbox/Uncategorized-ToSort`

  - Notable rclone move output summary (from the run):
    - Server-side moves were used when possible (fast, no transfer).
    - Transfer summary from the session: ~12.786 GiB moved via server-side operations; 422 items transferred/renamed.

H) Post-migration remote top-level (AFTER run)
  - Command: `rclone lsd Gdrive:` (after migration)
  - Notable top-level entries now:
    - `Active` (created)
    - `Archives` (created)
    - `Inbox` (created)
    - `System` (created)
    - `Documents／General／` (if present as remaining historical folder)
    - `fixed`, `test1` (left untouched)

I) Preview saved for `Active` tree
  - Command: `rclone tree Gdrive:Active | head -n 200 > /home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt`
  - File: `/home/allaun/gdrive_active_tree_head.txt` (preview of `Active` contents)

J) Notes and recovery reminders
  - The `Music-backup` and `Entertainment` folders were permanently deleted by explicit user instruction before the migration moves; they were not present to be migrated into `Active/Music` or `Active/Entertainment`.
  - If you want an auditable rclone log with full debug output for each command, I can re-run critical commands with `--log-file /home/allaun/rclone_debug.log --log-level DEBUG` (dry-run suggested first).

End of migration log.
